		  <th>S+</th>
		  <td>Aspen</td>
		  <td>Aspen trees are the coolest. They look amazing in the fall and their trunks are perfect. Fight me. Oh they also are perfect clones so that's awesome.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th>S</th>
		  <td>Oak</td>
		  <td>Oaks are a classic tree with no real downsides. They live like everywhere and they're fun to climb.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th>A</th>
		  <td>Maple</td>
		  <td>Maple trees are kind of like a slightly worse version of Oaks. Some redeeming qualities like helicopter seeds and good fall colors, but not enough to move into S tier</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th>B</th>
		  <td>Cherry</td>
		  <td>These are great during springtime when they are in bloom. The rest of the year they are pretty lackluster.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th>C</th>
		  <td>Cottonwood</td>
		  <td>Some people like cottonwood trees. Those people are idiots. It's not endearing to shed cotton everywhere, it's annoying! Solid C tier, never going to win tournaments.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <th>F</th>
		  <td>Bradford Pear</td>
		  <td>Absolute trash. You could actually get paid to kill these. Invasive, smell bad, garbage tier.</td>
